# odin-recipes

This project contains a basic website made up of a "Home" page (index.html) and a few other pages that will describe different recipes.

The completion of this project will demonstrate the learning of fundamental concepts and skills, such as the creation of the HTML boilerplate, proper use of elements like headers, lists, links, and so on; and the use of their respective attributes.
