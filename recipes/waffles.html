            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl;
                set aside. Beat egg yolks together in a bowl; add buttermilk, milk,
                and butter. Beat until well combined. Beat buttermilk mixture into
                flour mixture until well combined.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites and vanilla extract together in a bowl until soft
                peaks form; fold 1/2 into buttermilk batter until combined. Repeat
                with remaining 1/2 egg whites.</li>
            <li>Ladle batter into the preheated waffle iron; cook until waffles are
                golden and crisp and iron stop steaming, about 5 minutes. Transfer
                to a paper towel-lined plate to prevent sogginess. Repeat with
                remaining batter.</li>
